# ⭐ S – Situation

Retail organizations require clear visibility into financial performance, customer behavior, and operational risk.  
Raw transactional datasets often lack structured relationships and analytical measures needed for strategic decision-making.

The goal was to transform multi-source retail data (transactions, customers, products, stores, regions, and returns) into a scalable analytical model and executive-ready dashboard.
